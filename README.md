# Air Quality Index (PM2.5) Prediction

Although mostly invisible to the naked eye, the air we breathe is full of tiny particles of chemicals, soil, smoke, dust or allergens, also known as particulate matter, or PM. High PM poses a risk to human health and the planet as a whole.
Necessary precautions must be taken to mitigate the harmful effects of the PM. This project predicts Air Quality Index of Delhi so that precautions can be taken in advance.
After all, prevention is better than cure!

## To create a predictive model of PM2.5 levels in New Delhi
The steps include: importing and cleaning the data, visualizing the features, implementing ML algorithms, evaluating the models and deploying the best model in a web service.
